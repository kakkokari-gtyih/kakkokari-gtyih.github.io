I had the pleasure of attending [Vue Fes Japan 2025](https://vuefes.jp/2025/), Japan's largest Vue.js conference, held in Tokyo on October 25, 2025!

I had always vaguely thought, "I'd like to go to a tech conference like this someday," but most major events are held in Tokyo.
For me, living in Osaka, this was a bit of a barrier. However, this time, thanks to the [**Student Support Program**](https://vuefes.jp/2025/#student-support), my **travel expenses and lunch were covered**! Thank you so much. And that means...

*This post was brought to you by Vue Fes Japan[^1].*

[^1]: This is a parody of the sponsor credits often seen on Japanese commercial TV. I wanted to say it once.

Many of the projects I'm involved in, including the [Misskey Project](https://misskey-hub.net/), use Vue as their frontend framework. I was really looking forward to this event as a chance to see the cutting edge of Vue and its ecosystem, and real-world case studies from companies.

-----

The event was on a Saturday. I eagerly woke up in the 4 AM and headed to the venue via Shinkansen bullet train (it takes about 3.5 hours from Osaka to Tokyo).

The weather was unfortunately a light rain, but it wasn't pouring, which was a relief.

After checking in, I put on the original name card you could get by setting it up in advance and entered the venue.

![Vue Fes Japan 2025のネームカード](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/f1552627ad09-20251026.png)
*This was taken at a later date*

Evan (the creator of Vue) and kazupon (head of the Vue.js Japan User Group) entered the hall, and Vue Fes Japan officially began!

## Opening & Keynote

![キーノート開演前の会場の様子](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/3d45266d5418-20251027.jpg)

After a countdown, the [opening video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEtb0-fdMaE) (which was incredibly well-made), and a greeting from kazupon, the keynote speech by Evan began.

First, he spoke about Vue. I can't cover everything, but here are the points that left an impression on me, in bullet form:

* Vue's Vapor Mode now supports Suspense, Keep Alive, Transition, etc.!
    * I remembered seeing a keynote from a Vue conference overseas where this was still listed as WIP.
    * It seems like the full release is getting close... I'm excited.
* I already knew that Vue 3.6 would adopt Alien Signals as its internal reactivity system (meaning performance will improve without us having to do anything\!), but it was announced that **3.6 will be released by the end of the year**, which made me even more excited.

After that, he talked about the JavaScript toolchain. Why do we use build tools and bundlers? He gave a brief review, from their origins to recent trends, and explained why it's important to develop a unified set of Rust-based tools (like the oxc-based tools).

It's true that whether you're linting, formatting, or transforming code, you need to parse it into an AST to process it in a robust way. However, when using different tools from different authors, you might end up parsing into and stringify different ASTs, or even if they parse to the same AST, the coordination between tools might be poor, leading to inefficient processes where each tool repeatedly parses and stringifies.

I thought that by building a unified toolchain on a native codebase, we could not only get the performance advantage of native code but also reduce wasteful operation through better inter-tool coordination.

Several of these tools have already had their official release, so I want to try them out soon (personally, I'm thinking of using tsdown for building small libraries)!

## Platinum Sponsor Sessions

After the keynote, there were four sessions presented by Platinum Sponsor companies.

### "Is Vue Not Good with AI? That's Just an Urban Legend" (Mates Track)

The first one I attended was ["Is Vue Not Good with AI? That's Just an Urban Legend"](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/lmi#nakagam3) (Mates Track, Link and Motivation Inc.).

https://speakerdeck.com/lmi/vuefes2025-link-and-motivation

I hadn't really used AI agents for coding much before. While code completion features are incredibly useful and I rely on them, I've had many experiences with "vibe coding," where I don't get the output I want, and it ends up being faster to just write it by hand.

I was especially interested because I often hear people say that Vue is "weaker" when working with AI, compared to React or other JSX-based implementation.

In the case study they shared, they found that accuracy was achieved by first establishing rules like a design system and coding conventions, then verbalizing *everything* (including implicit rules), and giving the AI instructions layer by layer. In other words, the **"AI-friendliness" of the working/developing environment** has a much larger impact than the differences between frameworks.

It might be difficult to prepare such thorough rules and design systems for personal or small-scale projects. However, I thought that even then, establishing clear rules could probably help AI achieve a certain level of accuracy.

### "Exploring Framework-Agnostic Logic Sharing with alien-signals and Custom OSS" (FitFits with hacomono Track)

The second platinum sponsor session I attended was ["Exploring Framework-Agnostic Logic Sharing with alien-signals and Custom OSS"](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/yappli#aose-yuu) (FitFits with hacomono Track, Yappli, Inc.).

https://speakerdeck.com/aoseyuu/exploring-framework-agnostic-logic-sharing-with-alien-signals-and-custom-oss

This seems quite relevant, especially as organizations grow and having many products, or when you're migrating from one framework to another gradually, and you want to share logic across multiple frameworks. But you can't get a completely identical implementation because of subtle differences in each framework's concepts and processes. This talk was about ["sigrea"](https://github.com/sigrea), a library that they are developing to solve problem on sharing logic across multiple frameworks.

Its unique feature is that it is designed to minimize the need to be aware of differences between frameworks by writing common logic to functions in a similar way to writing composables in Vue, and then loading them inside the app framework (e.g. React, Vue) with sigrea adapters for each framework.

I haven't checked the actual code yet so I can't speak to the user experience, but it looks like it allows you to unify logic with a writing style similar to Vue's composables, which is promising. Making a mental note to remember this for when I encounter a multi-framework situation.

## Student Support Special Session

After the platinum sponsor session, it's lunch break for general attendees. However, those in the Student Support Program were invited to a special session and listened to four talks while enjoying our *bento* lunch box. First up were the talks from the Student Support Program sponsor companies.

![学生支援特別セッションにていただいたご飯（特製つくね弁当）](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/b6afb916efbd-20251027.png)
*I chose the Special Tsukune (chicken hamburg steak) Bento*

### "The Tech Stack and Development Behind LINE Official Account" (CyberAgent Track)

The first was ["The Tech Stack and Development Behind LINE Official Account"](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/lycorp#yusuke-sano) (CyberAgent Track, LY Corporation). They introduced their process for creating accessible, framework-agnostic components centered around "toly," a new design system born after the merger of LINE and Yahoo Japan.

toly uses Web Components (interesting!), and they seem to be using [Custom Elements Manifest](https://webcomponents.dev/docs/custom-elements-manifest) to automatically generate wrappers that absorb behavioral differences for each framework. I haven't had much exposure to Web Components and didn't know much about them, so this was a valuable talk that gave me hints on good practices for Web Component-based development, like managing components with Web Components as the base and auto-generating wrappers with Custom Elements Manifest.

By the way, why did they choose Web Components? I wonder if it's because they can unify the core logic based on standard APIs.

### "PLAID's Unique Technologies and the Reality of Internships" (CyberAgent Track)

The second student sponsor company talk was ["PLAID's Unique Technologies and the Reality of Internships"](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/plaid#takumi-katayama) (CyberAgent Track, Plaid, Inc.). They introduced some of the technologies Plaid uses, focusing on "KARTE Blocks" and their in-house systems.

https://speakerdeck.com/plaidtech/plaid-unique-tech-and-internship-life

This isn't related to Vue, but I'm currently participating in an [**<i>extra-ordinary</i>** Misskey server project that uses an in-house search engine](https://misskey.flowers/), so I was fascinated to hear that they build their own databases to handle massive amounts of analytics data and have a system for returning data in real-time. (By the way, that search engine is being developed by a different, ~~mad~~ data scientist, not me.)

There was also a demo of KARTE Blocks, and we could see the content switching in real-time. (It took a little time after saving in the editor, which makes me wonder; does that mean it's not building the site on-the-fly from structured data, but rather running a build on separate site code, outputting, and deploying it? I'm curious.)

### "What a Company That's Been Using Vue.js for 8 Years Is Thinking Now" (CyberAgent Track)

The last student sponsor talk was ["What a Company That's Been Using Vue.js for 8 Years Is Thinking Now"](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/studio#koya-saito) (CyberAgent Track, STUDIO Inc.). As long-time users who have been with Vue since the v1 days, they shared their unique insights.

They said that as their code scaled, their store structure and usage became complex and eventually overwhelmed. To address this, they established these best practices:

  * Don't use the same store just because it's the same page; have stores based on **concerns**.
  * Don't perform value transformations inside the store; extract them into separate functions (this improves usability and reduces side effects from changes).
  * When you need to *do* something based on a change in a store's value, handle that process *inside* the store, not in the component that uses the store.

I haven't encountered a program that uses a large-scale store yet (Misskey has its own custom-built store implementation for saving and loading values), but I'm sure this will be incredibly useful in the future, so I'll be sure to take notes on this!

### Panel Discussion: "Talents discovered by kazupon ─ Developer discovery techniques that change Vue.js and the OSS ecosystem" (CyberAgent Track)

The last part of the special session was a panel discussion with kazupon, Anthony Fu, and ubugeeei (facilitated by Naoki Haba). It was a valuable opportunity to hear how each of them got involved in the OSS community (and the Vue community) and, based on their experiences, how students should get involved in OSS and developer communities.

As I am also an OSS maintainer, I'll add my own episodes for each topic for reference.

#### Encountering the OSS Community

kazupon is an "OG" who adopted Vue at his company back in the v0 days. He said his first contribution to OSS wasn't code, but [localizing the documentation into Japanese](https://ja.vuejs.org/) (Vue's Japanese docs are fantastic, aren't they! It's a huge help). The community of Vue users also scaled up from small study groups to form the Vue Fes Japan we have today.

Anthony, on the other hand, started working on open source more from a self-serving motivation, and was then "discovered" by kazupon, after which he became even more into the OSS-related activities. I remembered seeing him say something similar on X just a few days ago:

> 「無私の奉仕」なんて、すごく重い言葉だよね。
> 
> 僕は OSS をやってるけど、一度もそれを「奉仕」だなんて思ったことはない。その下心は、隠してなくて、前にブログとかポッドキャストでも何回か話した。
> 
> コードは無償で公開してるけど、その代わりに僕は名前を知ってもらえたり、技術的な評価をもらえたり、今の仕事を得られたり、いろんな友達に出会えたり、旅のチャンスが増えたり、金銭的なサポートを受けたり、単純に「気持ちいい」って感じを得たりしてる。
> 
> そういう下心があっても、別に恥ずかしいことじゃないと思う。
> むしろ、みんながいろんな手段で、自分に合った生き方を見つけていけばいいと思う。
> 自分は OSS を通して今の生活を手に入れたから、自然とみんなにも OSS をやってみてほしいって思うんだ。
> 
> オススメです。
> 
> https://x.com/antfujp/status/1980904013563580623

ubugeeei encountered Vue at work. To understand its underlying mechanisms, he built a small-scale Vue implementation (Chibivue) for internal use. He felt it was a waste to keep it internal, so he published it as an open web book, which is when kazupon discovered him.

https://book.chibivue.land/

After that, he met [Kevin](https://github.com/sxzz), the creator of Vapor Mode, at the Vue Fes afterparty. When he mentioned Chibivue, he was invited to join the Vue development team.

---

There are many ways to engage with OSS, and I came to understand that being discovered by others can be an opportunity to expand your activities. In that sense, I thought events like Vue Fes hold significant meaning.

:::details My Encounter with Vue and the OSS Community

I first encountered Vue when I was building an [interactive quiz system (JP only)](https://zenn.dev/kakkokari_gtyih/articles/d592fd1d1e45dd) with web technologies for my school's cultural festival, to run on school-issued Chromebooks. At the time, I was using it by writing Vue templates directly into a plain HTML file and loading Vue from a CDN; I didn't know much about modern development with Node.js or bundlers yet. (Though, being able to just load it from a CDN like that is one of Vue's strengths, right?). However, I was hooked by the intuitiveness of just adding attributes like `v-if` and `v-for` to the HTML, and then just changing variables to see it reflected.

After that, I went through several [internal school projects](https://zenn.dev/kakkokari_gtyih/articles/7cd44a1b9356a3) and external projects, gradually getting used to modern development environments and Nuxt. Then, the series of events surrounding Twitter's acquisition by Elon Musk happened, where the platform's stability declined and specifications changed.

In the process, I found [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey). While I was impressed by Misskey's high level of real-time functionality and client flexibility, the frontend had a lot of noticeable bugs (I think it was around v13.10.0 at the time). As I looked into it, I realized the frontend used Vue and that development was conducted mainly in Japanese. I fumbled my way through setting up the Misskey development environment and submitted a bug fix.

▼ My first bug fix PR

https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/pull/10326

After that, I continued to occasionally find bugs and submit PRs to fix them. Then, one day, I suddenly received an invitation to the Misskey Organization and started working as a maintainer for the Misskey Project.

Since then, my OSS activities have been centered on developing the Misskey Project and related tools, including [reporting a Vue bug I found in Misskey (super rare\!)](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/issues/14170%23issuecomment-2244732049) to the [Vue core repository](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/11427) and [helping to fix it](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/11496), and [reporting a Nuxt bug](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/26882) I found while building the Misskey official website.

:::

#### How to Get Started, as a Student vs. as a Professional

Next, they discussed how students can get involved in OSS and community activities, as well as how professionals can do so.

kazupon said, "Trying to build a library from scratch is very difficult. It's better to start with something really small, like translating English documentation into Japanese. You can start from there." He also said, "Furthermore, OSS isn't something you do out of obligation. The most important thing is **doing something you personally enjoy**. If you do it out of a sense of duty, it becomes painful and difficult to continue."

Anthony said it's best to start by **trying to build something for yourself** (e.g., creating your own website or a tool you would use). Then, if you find a bug in a library you're using, that's your contribution chance! He explained that this becomes the entryway to OSS activities.

ubugeeei emphasized, much like kazupon, that coding isn't the only way to get involved in the OSS community. Drawing from his own experience of getting involved after meeting people, he said another way to start is to simply talk to people who are already active in OSS community, say "I want to participate too," and ask them to show you the ropes. (And places like conferences and Meetups, such as Vue Fes, are exactly where you can say that and meet those people.)

---

I personally started my OSS journey in a way very similar to Anthony's advice: by [fixing a bug in Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/pull/10326)—in other words, fixing a bug in a tool I use. And just as kazupon said, my motivation to continue comes from finding it "fun" (or having a strong desire to "fix this!").

On the other hand, the approach ubugeeei mentioned, "meeting people and asking them to teach you," is perhaps one I've been missing. Until now, my involvement in OSS has been centered on code contributions, but I was made to realize that networking at events like Vue Fes and getting involved in the community itself is a new way to enjoy OSS and a crucial aspect of it.

#### Behind the Scenes of Community Activities (Vue Fes Japan)

Next, they talked about the behind-the-scenes of community activities, specifically about organizing Vue Fes Japan.

kazupon held the first Vue Fes in 2018. He said they had no operational know-how at the time, but they were able to pull it off thanks to the hard work of staff members like [Oki-san](https://x.com/448jp). He mentioned that running the event is tough, but it's supported by many volunteer staff.

Anthony, who [moved to Tokyo this year](https://antfu.me/posts/ohayo-tokyo), said this was his first time participating as a staff member. He had previously attended Vue Fes as a speaker and was so impressed by the staff's hard work that he decided to join the staff as a way of giving back. By the way, the [Nuxt Tutorial](https://learn.nuxt.com/ja) that Anthony and the Vue.js Japan User Group developed and localized last year was also used in this year's hands-on workshop.

ubugeeei was the website lead for Vue Fes this year. He said that the staff is basically all-volunteer and anyone can join, so if you're interested, you should join the operations team.

---

Since I live in Osaka, I thought it would be difficult to participate directly in running Vue Fes. But I thought I'd like to get involved if Vue Fes Japan were ever held in Osaka or the Kansai region (holding it somewhere other than Tokyo sounds fun, doesn't it?).

#### How to Take the First Step into Community Activities

Finally, they each gave a message for people who want to start OSS or community activities.

* **kazupon:**
    * **Enjoying yourself** is the most important thing.
    * It can be something small, like attending a conference or writing a blog. If you continue to do what you're interested in while having fun, a path will naturally open up.
* **Anthony:**
    * It's good to **look for new OSS projects**.
    * In new projects, the response to Issues and PRs is fast, and it's easier to feel like you're actively participating (whereas in huge projects like Vue, responses might be slow or your contribution might get buried).
* **ubugeeei:**
    * The title of this session is "The Talents kazupon Found." This means students are on the side of "getting discovered."
    * To get discovered, you have to **share what you are doing**.
    * Community members are watching social media, and that can sometimes lead to a message like "I saw your tweet, would you like to contribute to this project?"

---

I am convinced that sharing what you're doing is a good thing. By sharing frequently, you get reactions and sometimes feedback. It can be the catalyst for wonderful chemical reactions and improve the project, as well as your skill itself. I hope to continue putting my experiences into words and output them as articles and blog posts.

## General Sessions

After lunch, we returned to the general sessions for all attendees, with talks starting simultaneously in four rooms (tracks).

### Daniel Roe: "Beyond the Framework: Building for the Next Decade of the Web" (FitFits with hacomono Track)

This was a talk by Daniel, the Nuxt core team lead. Rather than just being about Nuxt, it felt more like he was imparting his mindset or best practices for navigating the fast-changing world of web frontend development.

https://roe.dev/talks

Broadly, I learned the importance of:

1.  That you yourself are irreplaceable
2.  To leverage frameworks
3.  To build with other people

When you leverage a framework, you gain access to features that absorb the differences between underlying libraries or platforms, or make the libraries themselves easier to use. For example, Nuxt provides component auto-imports and file-based routing, and has deployment presets for various platforms to help you get your app running smoothly. Furthermore, using a framework might absorb some of the breaking changes from those underlying libraries. And these frameworks are being continuously improved by open-source community members who are experts in best practices. Thinking about it this way, I started to feel that relying on a high-level framework isn't a bad choice at all.

For my personal projects, I've basically used Nuxt for apps that need SSR or static sites, and a simple Vite + Vue setup for SPA-only apps. Of course, Nuxt can also output an SPA, but I had assumed it would include some kind of overhead (like code for SSR or SSG hydration), so I opted for the simpler application setup. However, in reality, Nuxt's own performance is excellent, and most of the time, the cause of a slow app is the user-side implementation. Considering the Developer Experience (DX) that frameworks provide, I've started to think that adopting a high-level framework might be a good idea even for SPA projects.

-----

One impressive thing about Daniel's talk was the unique interactivity, including a real-time reaction feature and polls.

After the main topic, he gave a brief introduction to Nuxt 4.2, and there was a surprise where **he actually released [v4.2.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/releases/tag/v4.2.0) right there on the spot**! Overall, it was a very exciting session.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/730af6b19397-20251105.jpg)
*Daniel releasing Nuxt 4.2.0 on the spot!*

### Guillaume Chau: "rstore and the challenge of building a local-first store" (FitFits with hacomono Track)

I skipped one session to go see the corporate booths, and next, I listened to Guillaume's talk on rstore. I had seen the name "rstore" somewhere before, but that was it. I was curious, so I decided to check it out.

https://slides.akryum.dev/2025-10-rstore-vue-fes/

rstore is a tool that encapsulates features like real-time data sync and offline data change application, allowing the frontend to fetch and update data without worrying about these things. He demonstrated its actual behavior by modifying the code of a demo app displaying a Pokémon list live on stage.

rstore might be sufficient for many state management needs. I get a "Yosasou™[^2]" feeling, so I'll try playing with it later.

[^2]: Yosasou™ (良さそう™), which is a slang from Japanese developer community meaning "it somehow seems good."

And Guillaume also **released [v0.8.0](https://github.com/directus/rstore/releases/tag/v0.8.0), the version of rstore with offline support, right there on the spot** (to be precise, right after the talk due to network issues). Do you (overseas viewers) like this kind of thing (releasing something on stage)? 😆 I surprised at first but quite enjoyed it.

### Shingo Hiranuma: "The Cutting Edge of Reactivity in Vue 3.6: Mastering Vapor and alien-signals for Reactive Performance" (Future Architect Track)

Vue 3.6 is scheduled to have major performance improvements, like the experimental introduction of Vapor Mode and the replacement of the reactivity system with alien-signals. I decided to attend this talk to learn more about what and how is improving.

https://speakerdeck.com/hiranuma/alien-signals-noshi-jian-topahuomansuzui-shi-hua

He reviewed how Vue's reactivity system and DOM manipulation mechanisms have changed since v0, and then explained why Vapor and alien-signals are superior.

Originally, elements were controlled by directly managing and manipulating the DOM. To speed things up, a new layer called the Virtual DOM was created, and we've been controlling the DOM through it ever since. However, while it's faster than direct DOM control/manipulation (and has evolved to be even faster and more performant), the virtual DOM layer is still overhead. Therefore, Vapor Mode is the plan to get rid of the virtual DOM and achieve direct DOM manipulation in a more efficient way. Vapor Mode not only enhances performance but also leads to more lightweight output code, so it's a feature I'm looking forward to in future releases. By the way, Solid is a well-known framework that doesn't use a virtual DOM.

Although the internal structure changes significantly, a welcoming point is that compatibility is a priority. Apparently, as long as you don't have code specific to virtual DOM processes, existing code will generally work in Vapor Mode as-is. It's also possible to have both Vapor and virtual DOM approaches coexist, allowing for a gradual migration. Nice!

### Panel Discussion: "The Future of Frontend: Visions from React, Vue.js, and Svelte for the Next Decade" (FitFits with hacomono Track)

And then, it was time for the much-talked-about [star-studded panel discussion with key person from React, Vue, and Svelte](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/event?session=panel-discussion).

![パネルディスカッション開始前の会場の様子](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/1518f3c2c52e-20251105.jpg)
*The powerhouse lineup*

From the React side, Dan Abramov, former React core member / former Bluesky core member.
From the Svelte side, Svelte creator dominikg (who was actually standing right in front of me during Hiranuma-san's talk 😆).
And from the Vue side, Vue creator Evan You, with Kia King Ishii as the facilitator.

The discussion converged on this question: "In a development world where AI, represented by 'vibe coding,' is on the rise, what is the future of the web frontend?"

As these are the people who create the frameworks themselves, I had assumed they probably don't use AI much, since they deal with advanced code that AI can't yet handle. However, my assumption was partly wrong. While dominikg and Evan said they use vibe coding almost never or not at all, Dan mentioned he is actively using vibe coding for a personal project, developing a new AT-Protocol-based social app.

Furthermore, in response to the question "Are there plans to make framework designs AI-friendly?", (I believe it was) dominikg said: **"By preparing documentation and designs to be easily understandable for humans, they will naturally become understandable for AI as well."**
Of course, measures to make the system itself AI-friendly are possible (in fact, [Hono CLI](https://zenn.dev/yusukebe/articles/ff69c13ccafb28) has a feature to output docs in Markdown via a command), but that's only possible once the foundation is in place (in the case of a command that returns docs, high-quality documentation). In other words, if the solid documentation isn't there, that should be the priority.

This reinforced my understanding, as the [earlier platinum sponsor session](#platinum-sponsor-session-1-is-vue-not-good-with-ai-that-s-just-an-urban-legend-mates-track) also mentioned "AI-friendliness" in the context of setting up frameworks like coding rules and design systems. **If you have a system (in the broad sense) in place that makes it easy for a new human to onboard, that naturally leads to an AI-friendly one as well.**

### Anthony Fu: "Introducing Vite DevTools" (Future Architect Track)

The last session I attended was Anthony's talk on [Vite Devtools](https://github.com/vitejs/devtools). By the way, Anthony gave all of his talks today in Japanese (his Japanese was very good!).

[https://talks.antfu.me/2025/vuefes](https://talks.antfu.me/2025/vuefes)

"DevTools" (= Developer Tools) can sometimes refer to the tools for development themselves, or it can refer to "tools for making better use of the tools for development," like those built into a browser. This talk was about the latter.

Custom DevTools have been spreading, starting with Nuxt and Vue and moving to other frameworks like Astro. Anthony spoke of a grand plan to not only bring such DevTools to Vite but also to create a common standard for DevTools to allow unified browsing of all other DevTools.

Vite Devtools beautifully integrates features like chunk visualization and bundle optimization into a single toolset. Previously, these had to be implemented separately using Vite plugins or compatible Rollup plugins. But that's not all. It's structured to be even more convenient by allowing JS framework-specific DevTools running on top of Vite DevTools to be used centrally through a common plugin system called the DevTools Kit. You could call it a Developer Experience (DX) revolution. It's incredible plan and I'm really looking forward to its future development.

Vite Devtools is currently under development. I'm excited to see its future progress!

## Other Events

There were also corporate booths, a free drink area, and a festival game corner.

### Corporate Booths

At the corporate booths, there was a [sticker rally event where you could get a prize for visiting all the booths](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/event%3Fsection%3Dsponsor-sticker-rally%23sponsor-sticker-rally), but I gave up partway through. I was tired from waking up at 4 AM and was mainly focused on attending the talks. However, I won a **giant bath towel (2nd prize)** in a lottery at the [Codmon Inc.](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/codmon) booth! Also, at the [StockMark Inc.](https://vuefes.jp/2025/en/sponsors/stockmark) booth, I tested my "Vue prowess" that I've trained through daily Misskey development (it was a test to see how many Vue directives you could recall in 90 seconds) and received a **"I Fully Understood Vue" T-shirt**. I made out pretty well! Thank you!

### Free Drink & Snack Corner

I'm at that age where coffee is too bitter, so I skipped it. There were snacks too, so maybe I should have grabbed some. (I heard that water was also being handed out, but it was gone by the time I went, so I don't know for sure.)

### Festival Game Corner

I had to skip this too because my luggage was big and it was hard to move around. It seems they had games like *katanuki* (die-cutting candy), ring toss, and *rakugaki senbei* (doodle rice crackers).

### After Party

*The after party*

I can't drink alcohol, but I was old enough to attend, so I joined. My social anxiety flared up, so I couldn't just go up and talk to everyone, but I *did* succeed in talking to some amazing people!

  * **Kainoa Kanter** ([@t1c.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/t1c.dev)): The person who used to develop the Misskey fork "Firefish" (aka. ThatOneCalculator).
      * He was very friendly and saved me from being all alone at the after party.
      * He said he's started development on a new social platform!
  * **Daniel Roe** ([@roe.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/roe.dev)): Nuxt Team Lead.
      * He had liked my posts on Bluesky and stuff every now and then.
      * And believe it or not, **he knew about Misskey (\!\!)**
      * Apparently, he had lunch with Kainoa the day before Vue Fes, and **my name came up (?!?!).**
  * **Dan Abramov** ([@danabra.mov](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov)): Former React Core Member / Former Bluesky Core Member.
      * Kainoa was talking to him and they were having a lively conversation, but I failed to jump in and couldn't talk to him (What am I doing, seriously...)

It was great to talk to people from overseas, but I felt my English skills were a bit lacking. I could understand most of the conversation, but if I lost focus for even a second, I'd often lose track of what they were saying. Also, I was just bad at speaking, so I think I want to get a little better at speaking English.

I also got to talk with other developers my age (= students)! It was a lot of fun! Let's talk again 🙌

I had valuable conversations with so many people, but I was really disappointed I couldn't talk to people from the Japanese Vue community (like kazupon and ubugeeei). **So,** a few days later, I joined the [chibivue Discord server](https://book.chibivue.land/00-introduction/010-about.html#%F0%9F%A6%80-about-the-discord-server) (I had been curious about it for a while because of mysterious reactions like "Aaaah Anthony"). It seemed like a very chill atmosphere, so to start, I dropped a picture of the hamburger I ate for lunch yesterday. Is this really the right way to do things? Please come and interact with me at your leisure.

*Burger Ou[^3]*

[^3]: The administrator of this server, ubugeeei, is called Ou, which translates to "king" in Japanese. So I made a pun on Burger King and posted "Burger Ou (バーガー王)."

## Conclusion

And so, that was my report on Vue Fes Japan 2025, my first-ever tech conference. I had an incredibly rich and dense time! Not only did I get to experience the cutting edge of Vue and frontend development, but I was also satisfied because I got to meet people I would normally never be able to meet, and it was a chance to get a glimpse of how frontend development is actually done at companies. See you all again!
